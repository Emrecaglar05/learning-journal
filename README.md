# ðŸ§  Learning Journal â€“ Data Science, AI & Agents

Welcome to my personal learning journal!  
Here, I track my journey through articles, concepts, and small projects in the fields of **Data Science**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **AI Agents**.

Each week, I:
- Read 1â€“2 important articles
- Summarize what I learned
- Implement a small practical example
- Document my notes in this repository
